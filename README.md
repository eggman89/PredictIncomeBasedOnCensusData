# PredictIncomeBasedOnCensusData
Predict whether income exceeds $50K/yr based on census data.

Dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult

This project train Random Forest with around 30k enteries of adult persons. Our aim is to correctly predict if the the users from the test data would would earn more than 50k dollar a year or not.

Test one: We run the test data as it is on the model. The accuracy is about 80%. Since this is a binarry classification, 80% is not a great result.

Test two: We predict the missing values and make a new dataset. We now test this set against the model.
